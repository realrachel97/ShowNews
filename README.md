## Reflection 
This was a side project built during my second year at the University of Southern California. Project goals included using Android technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with the Android development.  
   
### Technologies implemented

* **Android MVVM architecture** for development pattern
* **JetPack navigation component** for navigation
* **Recycler View** for showing news
* **Room** for database to support offline mode
* **Retrofit** for pulling the news from NEWS RESTful endpoint
* Third-party library **CardStackView** for tinder-like swiping cards (CardStackView library can be found here: [Link](https://github.com/yuyakaido/CardStackView))
